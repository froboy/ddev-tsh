# DDEV Tsh

## Overview

This add-on integrates [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/) and its command line tool, [tsh](https://goteleport.com/docs/connect-your-client/tsh/) into your [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) project.

Teleport is an open-source platform that provides secure access to SSH, Kubernetes, databases, and internal applications. The `tsh` command allows users to connect to infrastructure via Teleport and manage their resources. If your infrastructure is behind a Teleport proxy, this add-on allows you to:

- use `tsh` commands directly within your DDEV project, and 
- configure [drush aliases](https://www.drush.org/latest/site-aliases/#kubernetes) to connect to remote environments.

## Installation

It is recommended to use this add-on in conjunction with the [DDEV Kubernetes add-on](https://github.com/MurzNN/ddev-kubernetes). If you have [DDEV >=1.24.8](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.8) this will be done automagically! If not, please install it first:

```shell
 ddev add-on get MurzNN/ddev-kubernetes
```

To install the `ddev-tsh` add-on, run the following command in your DDEV project directory:

```shell
 ddev add-on get froboy/ddev-tsh
```

During installation, you will be asked to input your Teleport configuration:

- username
- proxy (e.g. `teleport.example.com:443`)
- cluster (e.g. `teleport.example.com`)
- k8s cluster (if applicable). 

You can skip any if you don't need them or don't know them yet.

After installation, adjust any files for your project needs. Remove `#ddev-generated` from any files that you edit, as they will be overwritten on the next `ddev restart`.

As always, after install or modifying any config, run:

```shell
 ddev restart
```

## Usage

| Command          | Description                                                                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ddev tsh`       | Passthrough for the [tsh](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/cli/tsh/) command |
| `ddev tsh-login` | Log in to a Teleport server and connect to a k8s cluster.                         |

## Advanced Customization

If you are using drush aliases, you will want to set up a drush alias using `kubectl` to connect to your Teleport cluster. 

For example, in `drush/sites/example.site.yml`:
```yaml
my-site-k8s:
  kubectl:
    namespace: 'my-site'
    resource: 'deploy/my-site'
    container: 'php'
    tty: true
    interactive: true
  paths:
    drush-script: /path/to/project/vendor/bin/drush
  uri: https://my-site.example.com/
  ```

Please note that `tty` and `interactive` are set to `true` to allow for interactive commands via `tsh` in the container.
